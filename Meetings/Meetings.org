#+TITLE: Running meetings efficiently

* General hints

- For larger group there should be person to moderate and one for
  taking notes

- Before:
  - Compile an agenda
  - Set time frames (tell how long each item should be discussed)
  - Send agenda early enough to the other participants
  - Clarify the channel (meeting in person, video call, phone call)

- During the meeting:
  - 

- After the meeting:
  - Extend the minutes by furter links and background info if needed
  - Add your tasks to you own plan

* Meeting minutes:

- Write down results and decission, not the whole discussion
- Note the next steps and task Attach persons directly to tasks (one
  single person is responsible for the outcome) it should be clear:
  Who is doing what until when?
- And next meeting date, add this for the different time zone if
  needed

- 1. Decide if there actually needs to be a meeting. If the only
  purpose is to share information, send a brief email instead.
- 2. Write and circulate an agenda. If nobody cares enough to do this,
  the meeting doesn't need to happen.
- 3. Include timings in the agenda to help you keep the meeting
  moving.
- 4. Prioritize. Things that will have high impact but take little
  time should be done first.
- 5. Put someone in charge. This doesn't mean doing all the talking,
  any more than being a referee means kicking the ball the most.
- 6. Require politeness. No one gets to be rude and no one gets to
  ramble (because the purest form of politeness is respecting others'
  time).
- 7. No technology. Insist that everyone put their phones, tablets,
  and laptops into politeness mode (i.e., closes them).
- 8. No interruptions. Participants should raise a finger or put up a
  sticky note if they want to speak, and the chair should handle
  sequencing.
- 9. Record minutes. Write down the most important pieces of
  information that were shared, every decision that was made, and
  every task that was assigned to someone.
- 10. Take notes. While other people are talking, participantsshould
  take notes of questions they want to ask or points they want to
  make. (You'll be surprised how smart it makes you look when it's
  your turn to speak.)
- 11. End early. If your meeting is scheduled for 10:00-11:00, you
  should aim to end at 10:55 to give people time to get where they
  need to go next.
- As soon as the meeting is over, the minutes should be circulated so
  that people who weren't at the meeting can keep track of what's
  going on.
