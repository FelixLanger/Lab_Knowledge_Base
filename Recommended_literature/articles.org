	abstract = {Gene regulatory networks have an important role in every process of life, including cell differentiation, metabolism, the cell cycle and signal transduction. By understanding the dynamics of these networks we can shed light on the mechanisms of diseases that occur when these cellular processes are dysregulated. Accurate prediction of the behaviour of regulatory networks will also speed up biotechnological projects, as such predictions are quicker and cheaper than lab experiments. Computational methods, both for supporting the development of network models and for the analysis of their functionality, have already proved to be a valuable research tool.},
