	abstract = {Gene regulatory networks have an important role in every process of life, including cell differentiation, metabolism, the cell cycle and signal transduction. By understanding the dynamics of these networks we can shed light on the mechanisms of diseases that occur when these cellular processes are dysregulated. Accurate prediction of the behaviour of regulatory networks will also speed up biotechnological projects, as such predictions are quicker and cheaper than lab experiments. Computational methods, both for supporting the development of network models and for the analysis of their functionality, have already proved to be a valuable research tool.},

	abstract = {Small RNAs (sRNAs) are central regulators of gene expression in bacteria, controlling target genes posttranscriptionally by base pairing with their mRNAs. sRNAs are involved in many cellular processes and have unique regulatory characteristics. In this review, we discuss the properties of regulation by sRNAs and how it differs from and combines with transcriptional regulation. We describe the global characteristics of the sRNAâ€“target networks in bacteria using graph-theoretic approaches and review the local integration of sRNAs in mixed regulatory circuits, including feed-forward loops and their combinations, feedback loops, and circuits made of an sRNA and another regulator, both derived from the same transcript. Finally, we discuss the competition effects in posttranscriptional regulatory networks that may arise over shared targets, shared regulators, and shared resources and how they may lead to signal propagation across the network.},

	abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

	abstract = {Small RNAs are ubiquitously present regulators in all kingdoms of life. Most bacterial and archaeal small RNAs (sRNAs) act by antisense mechanisms on multiple target mRNAs, thereby globally affecting essentially any conceivable traitâ€“stress responses, adaptive metabolic changes, virulence etc. The sRNAs display many distinct mechanisms of action, most of them through effects on target mRNA translation and/or stability, and helper proteins like Hfq often play key roles. Recent data highlight the interplay between posttranscriptional control by sRNAs and transcription factor-mediated transcriptional control, and cross talk through mutual regulation of regulators. Based on the properties that distinguish sRNA-type from transcription factors-type control, we begin to glimpse why sRNAs have evolved as a second, essential layer of gene regulation. This review will discuss the prevalence of sRNAs, who they are, what biological roles they play, and how they carry out their functions.},
