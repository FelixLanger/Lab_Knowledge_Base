#+TITLE: Writing a thesis

Before you start your project:
- Write an  expose / research proposal about your project https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_proposal

- Begin with the end in mind: Generate a thesis document that you can;
  add references and basic ideas while doing you project. It will be
  then easier in the end to fill add the details

Master thesis:
- Ideally do F1 / F2 befor having a master thesis.

- You are responsible for your work

- There are **rare** cases where a Wikipedia article can be used as a
  reference. If so give the exact version (use the links in the
  history tab).
