#+TITLE: Automate everything

Motivation:
- First larger time investment but on the long term automation saves time
- Reproducibility and "executable" documentation of your work

Examples for some handy tools:
- Have script that informs  you when your job on the server is done
- Have a script for uploading files to our web server and generate link
  incl. hash sum etc.
