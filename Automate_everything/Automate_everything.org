#+TITLE: Automate everything

Whenever you do something more than once consider to automate it
e.g. by a simple script or even more suffisticated solution. Data
analysis should always be scipted in order to make them reproducible
but also processes like creating a new project, making data available
for others on server or paper work can often be automized.

Motivation:
- First larger time investment but on the long term automation saves time
- Reproducibility and "executable" documentation of your work

Examples for some handy tools:
- Have script that informs  you when your job on the server is done
- Have a script for uploading files to our web server and generate link
  incl. hash sum etc.
