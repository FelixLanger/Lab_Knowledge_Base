- Optimize how you interact with you desktop environments. 
  - set/use keys for often use actions (open terminal, open editor,
    close window, maximize windoe, switch window etc.)
  - organising different contexts and transitions between them - e.g.
    - IDE like PyCharm with panels for different activities or
      different Emacs buffers (editing buffer, shell buffer)
    - tmux windows/panels
    - stacked windows and switching with keyboard shortcuts (for many
      desktop environents Alt-Tab works)
    - tilling window managers
    - different virtual desktops or physical screens
    - Put the editor into the background (Ctr-z), run the test (or
      other task) and use /fg/ to bring it back to the foreground.
  - Reduce the usage of a compute mouse
